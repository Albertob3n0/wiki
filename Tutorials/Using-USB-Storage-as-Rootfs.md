# Using USB Storage as Rootfs (extroot)

*This tutorial is on how to use the USB storage device as the rootfs. If you simply want to use the USB storage device to store files (i.e., you won't be installing anything to it), then read [[Tutorials/Using-USB-Storage]]*.

The Omega comes with 16MB of flash storage. While this is enough for the majority of hardware-related tasks, having extra storage space is always better. Even though you can plug in external USB storage devices to teh Omega, but because application packages are typically designed to be installed in the root filesystem (rootfs), those of you who want to install larger `opkg` packages would still be limited by the 16MB flash size.

Luckily, with extroot, you can mount your USB storage device to the rootfs. There are two approaches to this:
* With **pivot-overlay**, you can mount your USB storage device to `/overlay`, which is the writable part of your filesystem that's merged with `/rom` (the read-only part of your filesystem) to generate `/`.
* With **pivot-root**, you can mount your USB storage device to both `/overlay` and `/rom`, which essentially allows you to replace Omega's on-board flash with yoru USB storage device.

# extroot with pivot-overlay

Pivot-overlay is the recommended extroot implementation because it is easier to set up and future firmware upgrade will still be written to Omega's flash (instead of your USB storage device).

## Step 1. Prerequisites

Using extroot requires the following packages, all of them should already be installed on the default Omega firmware. But just in case you are using your own firmware, here they are again:
* `block-mount`
* `kmod-fs-[filesystem of choice]`, typically `kmod-fs-ext4`
* `kmod-usb-storage-extras`

Install the packages with `opkg`:

```
opkg update
opkg install block-mount kmod-fs-ext4 kmod-usb-storage-extras
```

You also need to have a USB storage device formatted to ext4 (or another filesystem you chose above).

## Step 2. Mounting the USB Storage Device

Next, plug in your USB storage device. If your device is detected correctly by the Omega, it will show up at a device under the `/dev` directory, usually `/dev/sda1`.

Then, create a mount point for your device if you don't already have one with the following command:

```
mkdir /mnt/sda1
```

Finally, mount the device:

```
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1
```

Your USB storage device should now be accessible at `/mnt/sda1`.

## Step 3. Duplicating the `/overlay` Directory

Now, we are ready to move the `/overlay` directory into the USB storage device. 

```
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt ; tar -C /overlay -cvf - . | tar -C /mnt -xf - ; umount /mnt
```

## Step 4. Setting up the `/overlay` Directory to Automount on Startup

First, we are going to generate the `fstab` template:

```
block detect > /etc/config/fstab
```

Then, we are going to edit the `/etc/config/fstab` file, which we have just created, to enable auto-mounting the `/overlay` directory. Look for the line

```
option  enabled '0'
```

and change it to 

```
option  enabled '1'
```

Save the file and restart the Omega:

```
reboot
```

And voil√†! Your Omega should automatically mount the `/overlay` directory. From this point on, all changes to your filesystem will be made on your USB storage device. Please remember that if you startup your Omega with out plugging in the USB storage device, some settings may be different because all the settings will be saved on your USB device.
