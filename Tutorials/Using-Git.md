## What is Git

Git is a popular [version control](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) system that allows coders to track changes to their codebase, easily collaborate with others, and manage their project.

Git is the version control system used by [GitHub](https://github.com/), the super popular online web-based repository hosting service. The team at Onion uses GitHub exclusively for all of our version control needs.
