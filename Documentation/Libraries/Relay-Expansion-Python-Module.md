# Relay Expansion Python Module

The Onion PWM Expansion Python module, `relayExp` is based on the [C Relay Expansion Library](./Relay-Expansion-C-Library). Using this module, you will be able to control the Relay Expansion from within your Python program.

[//]: # (Programming Flow)

# Programming Flow

After each power-cycle, the chip that controls the Relay Expansion must be programmed with an initialization sequence. After the initialization, the relays can be turned on and off at will.



[//]: # (I2C Device Address)

# I2C Device Address

The Relay Expansion is the only expansion that has a configurable I2C device address. This was done so that up to eight Relay Expansions can be stacked on a single Omega, giving the user the ability to control 16 relay modules independently.

The base device address is `0x20`, the dip switches control the offset added to the base address:
* The 'Off' position for each switch is when the toggle is close to the numbers on the switch, or away from the relay modules.
* The 'On' position is when the toggle is away from the numbers on the switch, or closer to the relay modules.

The table below defines the relationship:

| Switch 1 | Switch 2 | Switch 3 | I2C Device Address |
|----------|----------|----------|--------------------|
| Off      | Off      | Off      | *0x27*             |
| Off      | Off      | On       | *0x26*             |
| Off      | On       | Off      | *0x25*             |
| Off      | On       | On       | *0x24*             |
| On       | Off      | Off      | *0x23*             |
| On       | Off      | On       | *0x22*             |
| On       | On       | Off      | *0x21*             |
| On       | On       | On       | *0x20*             |


**All of the functions in this library will require an address argument that specifies the offset to add to the base address of `0x20`**

# The Python Module

The `relayExp` Python Module in the `OmegaExpansion` package provides a wrapper around the C library functions. The functions are largely the same as their C counterparts, including the arguments and return values. Any differences from the C library will be explicitly mentioned below. 


[//]: # (Source Code)

## Source Code

The source code can be found in the [Onion `i2c-exp-driver` GitHub Repo](https://github.com/OnionIoT/i2c-exp-driver).



[//]: # (Using the Python Module)

## Using the Python Module

**Installing the Module**

To install the Python module, run the following commands:
```
opkg update
opkg install python-light pyRelayExp
```

This will install the module to `/usr/lib/python2.7/OmegaExpansion/`

*Note: this only has to be done once.*


**Using the Module**

To add the Onion Relay Expansion Module to your Python program, include the following in your code:
``` python
from OmegaExpansion import relayExp
```

The functions are largely the same as their C counterparts, including the arguments and return values. Any differences from the C library will be explicitly mentioned below.


[//]: # (Python: Example Code)

## Example Code

Example code that uses the `relayExp` module can be [found here](https://github.com/OnionIoT/i2c-exp-driver/blob/master/examples/relay-exp.py), in the `i2c-exp-driver` Onion GitHub Repo.



[//]: # (Python: Return Values)

## Return Values

All functions follow the same pattern with return values:

If the function operation is successful, the return value will be `0`.

If the function operation is not successful, the function will return `1`.


[//]: # (Functions)

## Functions

Each of the main functions implemented in this module are described below.


[//]: # (Python: Init Function)

### Initialization Function

To perform the initialization sequence on the Relay Expansion:
``` python
relayExp.driverInit(addr)
```

After this step is completed, the functions to set the relay states can be used with success.

**Arguments**

The `addr` argument is described above in the [I2C Device Address section](#i2c-device-address).

**Examples**

Initialize a Relay Expansion with all switches set to 0, meaning the I2C device address will be 0x27:
``` c
status 	= relayExp.driverInit(7)
```

Initialize with switches set to on-on-off (device address: 0x24):
``` c
status 	= relayExp.driverInit(4)
```


[//]: # (Python: Check Init Function)

### Check for Initialization

Performs several reads to determine if the Relay Expansion requires the initialization sequence to be programmed before the relay states can be changed:
``` python
relayExp.checkInit(addr)
```

The **return value** of the function indicates the Initialization Status:

| Return Value | Initialization Status |
|--------------|-----------------------|
| 0            | Not Initialized       | 
| 1            | Initialized           | 

**Arguments**

The `addr` argument is described above in the [I2C Device Address section](#i2c-device-address).


**Example**

Check if a Relay Expansion (with switches set to Off-On-On) is initialized:
``` python
bInit 	= relayExp.checkInit(1)

if (bInit == 0):
	print 'The Relay Expansion needs to be initialized'
else:
	print 'The Relay Expansion is good to go!'
}
```


[//]: # (Python: Set Relay State)

### Set Relay State

Use this function to change the state of the relay:
``` python
relayExp.setChannel(addr, channel, state)
```

**Arguments**

The `addr` argument is described above in the [I2C Device Address section](#i2c-device-address).

The `channel` argument selects the relay in question. See the [diagram above](#functions_types) for info on which channel corresponds to which relay.

The `state` argument allows the user to select if the relay will be turned on or off:
* 0 turn the relay OFF
* 1 turn the relay ON

**Example**

Set channel 0 to On (all switches are On):
``` python
status 	= relayExp.setChannel(0, 0, 1)
```


[//]: # (Python: Set Relay State for Both Relays)

### Set State for both Relays

In the event that both relays need to be turned on or off at the same time:
``` python
relayExp.setAllChannels(addr, state)
```

This is performed with a single register write so both relays should react at the same time.


**Arguments**

The `addr` argument is described above in the [I2C Device Address section](#i2c-device-address).

The `state` argument allows the user to select if the relays will be turned on or off:
* 0 turn the relays OFF
* 1 turn the relays ON


**Example**

Turn both channels off (all switches are On):
``` python
status 	= relayExp.setAllChannels(0, 0)
```

Turn both channels on (all switches are On):
``` python
status 	= relayExp.setAllChannels(0, 1)
```



[//]: # (Python: Read Relay State)

### Read Relay State

Use this function to read the state of a specific relay:

``` python
state = relayExp.readChannel(addr, channel)
```


**Arguments**

The `addr` argument is described above in the [I2C Device Address section](#i2c-device-address).

The `channel` argument selects the relay in question. See the [diagram above](#functions_types) for info on which channel corresponds to which relay.

**Return Value**

The return value indicates the state of the relay channel in question:
* `0` indicating the relay is OFF
* `1` indicating the relay is ON

**Example**

Read the state of channel 0 (all switches are Off):
``` python
value 	= relayExp.readChannel(0, 0)
if value == 1:
	print 'Relay 0 is ON!'
else:
	print 'Relay 0 is OFF'
```
