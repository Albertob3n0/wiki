# Onion Wiki

Onion is **The Invention Platform For The Internet of Things**. Our hardware (Onion Omega) and software (Onion Cloud) work seamlessly together to simplify and democratize hardware development - making the Internet of Things more approachable and more accessible for everyone. Our mission is to provides the tools, knowledge & community support that lower the barrier of entry for developers to create Internet of Things applications.

### Getting Started

**Got your Omega? Here are the instruction to the** [[Get Started Guide|get-started]].

### Onion Omega

The Onion Omega is a powerful embedded computer with buit-in Wi-Fi. It is a hardware development platform designed specifically for software developers, and it allows makers and inventors to create connected applications extremely quickly. The Omega runs the full Linux operating system, and it allows you to prototype hardware devices using the familiar Linux commandline environment and to program hardware applications using high-level programming languages such as Python, PHP, and Javascript. The Omega is also fully integrated with the Onion Cloud, making it a breeze to connect physical devices to the Web, as well as delegating computationally-intensive tasks to powerful servers on the cloud.

### Full Linux Environment

The Onion Omega's powerful processor is capable of running the full Linux operating system. This means you can install OpenCV with a single command to add image recognition capabilities to your drone. You can use git to check out the latest changes your colleagues made to the coffee brewer. You can use pip or npm to incorporate libraries that allow your thermostat to talk to Twitter. The Onion Omega provides you with familiar tools that reduces learning curve and enhances your productivity in hardware development.

### Python, PHP, and Other High-Level Programming Languages

The Onion Omega can be programmed with high-level programming languages such as Python, Javascript (Node.JS), PHP, Ruby and many others. This means you can start hacking away at your ideas without needing to review your C pointer syntax or worrying about setting up cross-compilation environments.

### Seemless Cloud Integration

The Onion Omega is fully integrated with the Onion Cloud. This means that the Omega can interact with the myriad of Web services available and can also communicate with other Internet connected devices. In addition, the Onion Cloud allows the Omega to be accessed anywhere in the world quickly and securely through our highly customizable RESTful APIs. Building applications that interacts with the physical world has never been easier. The Onion Cloud is free for non-commercial use.

*[Currently in private beta, public release planned for Ando D2]*

### Onion Console

The Onion Console is a virtual desktop to help you manage connected devices such as the Omega. It runs in your browser or as an app on your smartphone, and it provides you with the familiar GUI environment and applications when working with embedded devices. The Onion Console makes the Omega easy to work with even if you don't have any Linux experience.

### App Store

We love the simplicity of installing apps on a smartphone, so we created the Onion App Store to make reprogramming the Onion Omega as simple as installing an app. The Omega is always connected, so reprogramming can take place anywhere and at any time. And since the Omega runs a multi-tasking operating system, it can be configured to run multiple programs simultaneously. The Onion App Store is open for everyone to share their creations to the world, and it even takes care of automatic updates and dependency management.
