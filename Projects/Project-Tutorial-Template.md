# Project Title

Intro on the topic of the project. 
So a small blurb on what the main goal and why it would be useful.

Include a relevant image:

A brief sentence describing exactly what this tutorial will walk the user through:
* The goal of the tutorial: What they will accomplish by completing this tutorial
  * What programming language, framework, or sofware the tutorial will use
* What hardware will be used

For example:

In this tutorial, we'll go through how you can use <Python> to <encode text into a QR Code> and <display it on your OLED Expansion.>

# What are QR Codes?

As mentioned earlier, QR codes (Quick Response Code) are essentially two-dimensional (or matrix) barcodes. They're an evolution of the ordinary barcode in every sense of the word: the data storage capacity is much larger, they can be processed and read by almost any imaging device, and error correction is built-in so even partial codes can be scanned.

The QR code data encoding algorithm defines a number of 'versions' that increase in size and store increasing amounts of data. The version (size) of a generated QR code depends on the amount of data to be encoded. Increasing the error correction level will decrease the storage capacity due to redundancy pixels being added.

QR Codes can be used in the same way as traditional barcodes, but with the advantages they have over barcodes, there's a variety of clever ways they can be used:
* Linking to websites
* Contact information
* Advertising
* Payment systems 
* Authentication and identification

To learn more about QR codes, visit the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code), it's jam-packed with all sorts of information.




[//]: # (The Actual Process)

# The Actual Process

**Give a brief description of what we're going to do on a technical level:**

Ok, here we go! First we'll install some required packages to make everything run smoothly, and then we'll grab the code for this tutorial from GitHub.

**Make sure to mention any repos**

All of the code can be found on this GitHub Repo: https://github.com/OnionIoT/oledQrCodeGenerator



[//]: # (The Steps)

## Step 1: <Step Title>

Each step should accomplish a small milestone in the overall process.

The first step will usually be using opkg to install some packages.


[//]: # (Step 2)

## Step 2: <Step Title>

Next step... 

### <Sub-step Title>

If it makes sense to break down a step into sub-steps (or provide additional details on a particular action), go for it. 


[//]: # (Step 3)

## Step 3: <Step Title>

As many steps as it takes to explain the tutorial.

### <Sub-step Title>

If the tutorial uses some custom code written by you, make sure you do a run-down of the structure of the code. Point-form is probably the best way to get your message across.


[//]: # (Step N)

## Step N: <Step Title>

On the last step, make sure to give an example:
* if the project is code-based, run it on an Omega and paste the output (including the command used to run it!)
* if the project is not code-based but provides some functionality, include a picture, gif, and/or video of it working




[//]: # (Using the Project)

# <Using the Project>

After the steps to setup and get the project running are done, write a short blurb on how it is meant to be used:

* For software based projects, talk about when the software would be used.
* For projects that create physical things, show how they are used
* Anything additional the user might have to do, like use a phone to interact with the project, etc

This is also a good place to include images, gifs, and/or videos.


## <Going Further>

A small outline of what could be done next and maybe a pointer on how to do it (ex: writing more code, installing certain software, adding to the hardware, etc)

If the project can be re-used or implemented as a part of a larger project, make sure to mention it. For example, your project is software-based, maybe explain how the code can be used by other programs (including a Python module, using a C library, that kinda thing).
