# GPIO Characteristics

The following data is the most accurate that we have available from the Atheros 9331 datasheet. We will update the list with values that we have tested, but otherwise take caution when designing and working in the field.

## GPIO Voltage

| Characteristic          | Min  | Max        |
|-------------------------|------|------------|
| Output High Voltage (V) | 2.44 | ---        |
| Output Low Voltage (V)  | ---  | 0.1        |
| Input High Voltage (V)  | 0.7  | 5 (tested) |
| Input Low Voltage (V)   | 0.3  | ---        |

## GPIO Current

Maximum drive: 24 mA
Pullup/Pulldown resistance: 200 kÎ©
