The Onion Omega is a powerful embedded computer with buit-in Wi-Fi. It is a hardware development platform designed specifically for software developers, and it allows makers and inventors to create connected applications extremely quickly. The Omega runs the full Linux operating system, and it allows you to prototype hardware devices using the familiar Linux commandline environment and to program hardware applications using high-level programming languages such as Python, PHP, and Javascript. The Omega is also fully integrated with the Onion Cloud, making it a breeze to connect physical devices to the Web, as well as delegating computationally-intensive tasks to powerful servers on the cloud.
